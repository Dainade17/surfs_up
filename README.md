The purpose of this assignment's challenge was to help W.Avy understand the temperature variations between the month of June and December to ensure the surf and ice cream shop will be profitable year round. 

To do this we have considered temperatures between 2017-06-01 and 2017-06-30 for June and between 2016-12-01 and 2016-12-31 for December. Both results are stored in data frames for easy visualization.

The min and max temperature for June ranges from 71 to 83 and for December it ranges from 60 to 78. This concludes that day time temperature remains on the higher 70s which is perfect for ice cream and surfing though out the year.
